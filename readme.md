# React web component spike

Spike assessing using stencils to build a platform agnostic design system in stencil.

This project uses a mono repo recommended in the stencils setup, in their docs they uses lerna, 
I'm going with pnpm
https://stenciljs.com/docs/react

Install the dependencies
```
pnpm i
```

Build the accordion and the react proxy
```
pnpm run build
```

Start the next app and navigate to localhost:3000
```
pnpm run dev
```
